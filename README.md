# predict-home-prices
Predict house prices from property size using Python and linear regression in Google Colab. This project covers data import, cleaning, visualization, model training, and prediction. Ideal for beginners, it demonstrates the full workflow of building and evaluating a simple machine learning model for real-world regression tasks.
House Price Prediction with Linear Regression
This project demonstrates how to predict house prices based on property size using Python and linear regression. Built in Google Colab, it guides you through the entire workflowâ€”from data import and cleaning, to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Features
Data Loading: Easily import and process Excel or CSV datasets of house prices and sizes.

Exploratory Analysis: Visualize the relationship between house size and price with scatter plots.

Model Training: Use scikit-learn's LinearRegression to fit a predictive model.

Validation: Split data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance and avoid overfitting.

Prediction & Visualization: Compare actual vs. predicted prices with clear plots.

Beginner-Friendly: Step-by-step code and explanations, ideal for students and newcomers to machine learning.

Getting Started
Upload your dataset (Excel or CSV) to Google Colab.

Follow the notebook to clean, visualize, and split your data.

Train a linear regression model and make predictions.

Visualize results and assess model accuracy.
